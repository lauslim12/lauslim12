Nice to virtually meet you.

I am a Software Engineer specializing in web and application development. Currently, I am also a final-year Computer Science university student. I have a strong foundation in Computer Science, and my way of life is making beautiful applications and software engineering. I will always try to work, take on projects, and force myself to level up and develop further in my spare time.

I am most skilled and comfortable using JavaScript, Python, and their families. I am familiar with the newest, cutting-edge technologies and trends such as CircleCI, Next.js, Docker, DevOps, NoSQL, CI/CD, and many others.

I love working in the open source, some of my best projects include [Anzu (a chatbot for LINE social messaging app)](https://github.com/lauslim12/Anzu), [an anime character data gatherer with a custom algorithm](https://github.com/lauslim12/Satella), and [an open-source happiness jar application](https://github.com/lauslim12/Fumi-no/). I have also contributed in several popular open source repositories, some of them being [LINE's API for Node.js](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-nodejs), [Genshin Impact Wish Simulator](https://github.com/uzair-ashraf/genshin-impact-wish-simulator), [Anime Face Detector with Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/qhgz2013/anime-face-detector), and [Genshin Schedule](https://github.com/chiyadev/genshin-schedule).

I have also written an academic research paper about [the implementation of Non-Deterministic Finite Automata for Vending Machines (Bahasa Indonesia)](http://proceeding.unindra.ac.id/index.php/simponi/article/view/375/0). I am the main developer of the Kompleks Application, an Android application written in Kotlin, used by several housing complexes in Jakarta to manage their visitors.

Check out all of my open source contributions (forks) at [@lauslim12-forks](https://github.com/lauslim12-forks), or my old code repositories at [@lauslim12-old](https://github.com/lauslim12-old)! I mostly keep the ones I believe are the best of my projects on my main profile.
