Hello everyone! üëã

I am currently a third-year Computer Science university student. I have a strong foundation in Computer Science, and I specialize (read: passionate) in making beautiful web applications, software development, and data related stuff. I love technology and will always try to work, take on projects, and force myself to level up and develop further in my spare time.

Presently, in university, I have had the chance to intern in a top IT company, which is IBM Indonesia as a Data Modeler Intern. Aside from IBM, I have also worked and interned in several companies, such as Nilam Sukses Mandiri, and Skifindo Integra Selaras.

At IBM, me and my partner developed a system that allows one to check and predict the financial performance of a company by its CXO personality, its financial data, and its reputation. Aside from that, we also had the chance to develop a virtual assistant (chatbot) for banking purposes.

I am most skilled and comfortable using JavaScript, Python, and their families. I am familiar with the newest, cutting-edge technologies and trends such as CircleCI, Docker, Next.js, DevOps, NoSQL, CI/CD, and many others.

I love working in the open source, some of my best projects include [Anzu, a chatbot for LINE](https://github.com/lauslim12/Anzu), [an anime character data gatherer with a custom algorithm](https://github.com/lauslim12/Satella), and [an open source hotel system](https://github.com/lauslim12/intract-social-network). I have also contributed in several open source repositories, some of them being [Genshin Impact Wish Simulator](https://github.com/uzair-ashraf/genshin-impact-wish-simulator), and [Anime Face Detector with Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/qhgz2013/anime-face-detector).

I have also written an academic research paper about [the implementation of Non-Deterministic Finite Automata for Vending Machines (Bahasa Indonesia)](http://proceeding.unindra.ac.id/index.php/simponi/article/view/375/0).

Get in touch with me by connecting with my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasdwiarto/) or [my personal website (still under maintenance)](https://www.nicholasdw.com).

See you around the world üåé!
