Hello everyone! 👋

I specialize in making beautiful web applications, software development, and data related stuff. My passion is there 👍

I am currently a third-year Computer Science university student. Unlike ordinary university students, I always try to work, take on projects (either personal, commercial, or internship), and force myself to level up and develop further in my spare time.

I have coded since I was in junior high school, my first language was everyone's favorite HTML. My first programming language was Ruby, and my first program was to write a calculator with it. It was sure fun and I was hooked up into the software engineering world!

In order to fulfill my passion for science and technology, let's collaborate together when you have a project that we could solve together 😀!

## 🏢 Experiences

- Python for general purpose programming language and science related things
- IBM Cloud Services for Cloud Computing
- Git, Heroku, Docker, Travis for DevOps
