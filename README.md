Hello everyone! 👋

I specialize in making beautiful web applications, software development, and data related stuff. My passion is there 👍

I am currently a third-year Computer Science university student. Unlike ordinary university students, I always try to work, take on projects (either personal, commercial, or internship), and force myself to level up and develop further in my spare time.

In order to fulfill my passion for science and technology, let's collaborate together when you have a project that we could solve together 😀!
